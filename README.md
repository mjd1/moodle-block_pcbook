This is a block which links to a pcbook server and shows how many of your
computers are free or busy.

Configuration

http://server1.example.com/pcbook

To only show the status of workstations whose names match a given string,
enter that in the pattern option, eg. 'room1-' will match machines with names
'room1-1', 'room1-2', etc.
